## Reading the Data
```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

#Data Exploration
## Question Set (Team)

<font color = grey> 1. What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated? </font>
```{r}
dim(choco)
```
There are 1852 chocolate bars rated

<font color = grey> 2. How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports. </font>
```{r}
# count sum of reviews for each year
years = c(2006:2017)

counts = c()
k = 1
for (i in years){
  counts[k] = sum(choco$Review.Date == i)
  k = k+1
}

choco_year = as.data.frame(cbind(years, counts))

# create bar chart
ggplot(choco_year, aes(x = years, y = counts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

There appears to be an increasing trend in chocolate ratings as time moves forward.

## Question Set (Individual)
<font color = grey> 1. How are ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any. </font>
```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Rating))+
  geom_histogram()
```

The ratings form a unimodal distribution that is slightly skewed to the left.  There are possible outliers at 1 and 5.

<font color = grey> 2. Do ratings depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar? </font>
```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Rating))+
  geom_jitter()
```

There does not appear to be a relationship between chocolate ratings and cocoa percentages from the scatterplot above.

<font color = grey> 3. How do ratings compare across different company locations? Focus on the three locations with the most ratings: </font>
```{r}
chorox <- choco[(choco$Company.Location %in% c('U.S.A.','France','Canada')),]

ggplot(chorox, aes(x = Company.Location, y = Rating)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Team Question
<font color = grey> 1. Dark chocolate with +70% cocoa are believe to have health benefits. Which North American countries produce "healthy" dark chocolate with the highest ratings? </font>
```{r}
#Identify dark chocolate in high producing locations
choco_dark <- choco[(choco$Cocoa.Pct >= 70) & (choco$Company.Location %in% c('Canada', 'Colombia', 'Ecuador','Guatemala', 'U.S.A.')),]
                                                 
# Original Lynn List                              c('Australia', 'Belgium', 'Canada', 'Colombia', 'Ecuador', 'France', 'Germany', 'Guatemala', 'Italy', 'Madagascar', 'Sao Tome', 'Scotland', 'Spain', 'Switzerland', 'U.K.', 'U.S.A.')),]

# chart Choca% and Ratings
ggplot(choco_dark, aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Rating)) +
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~Company.Location)
```

```{r}
choco_dark %>% group_by(Company.Location) %>% summarise(mean(Rating))

ggplot(choco_dark, aes(x = Company.Location, y = Rating)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

From the distribution of dark chocolates, we see that the five American countries have median ratings between 3 and 3.5 with Ecuador having the lowest (and the widest spread) followed by Canada, Guatemala, and U.S.A. at with similar medians, and Colombia with the highest median rating.  It is worth noting that while Columbia makes chocolate with +70% cocoa, it does not produce chocolate as dark as Canada, Ecuador, or U.S.A. do.

#Workflow: 
```
We used Lynn's GitHub as the main 'hub' to organize our work. She uploaded a file answering the beginning questions in R markdown, and as we discussed and proposed changes to the answers, we edited them and sent pull requests to her.
We worked on the individual questions on our own, and sent in requests for all of those, too. This used up all the time we had in class, so before we left, we assigned each of our group members responsibilities to finish the lab (Aisha summarizing the individual questions, Lynn handling the exploration question, 
and Prateek finishing the workflow and summary. We worked on these on our own, and as they were finished, sent in the changes to a new lab file (Aisha's), which contained all the changes.
```
